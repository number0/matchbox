Matchbox
========
*The duplicate image detection tool*

What is Matchbox?
-----------------
*Help! I have a million images and I'm sure there are duplicates, but which are they?*

Checking to identify duplicates manually is a very time-consuming and error-prone process. You need a tool to help you: Matchbox.

Matchbox is an open source tool which:

* provides decision-making support for duplicate image detection in or across collections
* identifies duplicate content, even where files are different (in format, size, rotation, cropping, colour-enhancement etc.), and if they have been scanned from different original copies of the same publication
* applies state-of-the art image processing  
* works where OCR will not, for example images of handwriting or music scores
* is useful in assembling collections from multiple sources, and identifying missing files

What Can Matchbox Do For Me?
----------------------------
Matchbox brings the following benefits:

* Automated quality assurance
* Reduced manual effort and error
* Saved time
* Lower costs, e.g. storage, effort
* Open source, standalone tool. Also as Taverna component for easy invocation
* Invariant to format, rotation, scale, translation, illumination, resolution, cropping, warping and distortions
* May be applied to wide range of image collections, not just print images

Examples
--------

There are numerous situations in which you may need to identify duplicate images in collections, for example:

* to ensure that a page or book has not been digitized twice
* to discover whether a master and service set of digitized images represent the same set of originals
* to confirm that all scans have gone through post-scan image processing
