\section{Troubleshooting}

\subsection{Old versions of Python - missing libraries}

The utility scripts in Matchbox were developed in Python 2.7. In older Python
versions some of the libraries that come with 2.7 are not installed out of the box. 
To use the utility scripts, these libraries have to be installed in one of Python's
library paths. They can be downloaded from \url{http://pypi.pyhton.org/}.

\subsection{New versions of Python - wrong syntax}

Attempts to use the utility scripts with Python 3.x will fail because
significant parts of the language have been changed from version 2.x to version
3.x. However, it is possible to install both versions in parallel on most
systems.
